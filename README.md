# Market analysis

## Purpose
A set of scripts I've written to process data from Kucoin and Bybit about crypto markets. Calculates things such as seasonality and % change. Not updated super frequently so bear in mind that if Bybit or Kucoin make API changes it has the potential of breaking one or more of the scripts.

## List of scripts
- `Kucoin Screener.Rmd` - Calculates a number of statistics, like beta to Bitcoin, for Kucoin perpetual futures
- `Bybit Screener.Rmd` - Calculates a number of statistics, like beta to Bitcoin, for Bybit perpetual futures
- `Bybit Seasonality.Rmd` - Finds seasonality over a predefined time period for Bybit perpetual futures.
